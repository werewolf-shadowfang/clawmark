# 2. gradient_border - Glowing borders, very visible
# 3. neon - Bold glowing effect
# 4. glass - Good with proper backdrop blur

# Color Customization:
# Button styles automatically adapt to your theme colors:
# - gradient_border: Uses primary/secondary colors for animated gradient
# - solid: Uses primary color for background fill
# - neon: Uses primary color for the glow effect
# - glass: Works with any background, uses theme colors for text/borders
# - All styles respect your theme's color palette

# Performance Notes:
# - gradient_border: Slight performance impact due to CSS animations
# - solid: No performance impact (fastest)
# - glass: Minimal performance impact (backdrop-filter)
# - neon: Minimal performance impact
# - rounded/square/pill: No performance impact

# Mobile Optimization:
# - All button styles are mobile-responsive
# - Gradient animations may be reduced on mobile for battery life
# - Touch targets remain properly sized (minimum 44x44px)
# - Glass effects may be simplified on older mobile devices

# - Using recommended color combinations
# - text_color provides sufficient contrast with button backgrounds
# - Interactive elements have clear focus states
# - Touch targets are adequately sized for mobile
